# Overview
{: .no_toc }
Custom scripting and automation works well in project delivery where there's usually one or two delivery engineers implementing the solution.  

The further we progress from delivery - design, implementation to operational hand-over, the more important the choice and supportability of automation tools becomes. Particularly in Enterprises where infrastructure and operations teams do not have easy, embedded as part of the team access to developers

This is where configuration automation or "Infrastructure as Code" tools such as Ansible have greater relevance, automation of environments at scale, where supportability and re-use by a wider team of engineers, each likely with varying levels of programming and automation skills.... Those organisations, where DevOps is still immature, or an aspirational goal.

Here we explore tools such as Ansible and Terraform to automate the deployment and configuration of network and data center infrastructure.
